# Example of factorisation of a permutation
# Instead of guessing factors (transpositions), I go the other way around, turning my Permutation into (1 2 3 ...) using only transpositions. To get the factors of our permutation we reverse their order and form their composition.
#Sigma1 = 
3 5 4 1 2
#Transposition Factors (In reverse order)
3 4
2 5
1 3
